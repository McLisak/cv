<p> An online course store. First big, fullstack project I implemented mostly on my own, asking my co-worker / mentor for advices and verifying ideas during development.
</p><p> Project built with PHP (CakePHP), MySQL, Apache, jQuery, CSS. It included a bunch of features like: <ul> <li>CMS / Admin panel</li> <li>online payments integration (tpay)</li> <li>protecting videos from being downloaded via browser extensions</li> <li>3rd party authorization via twitter and facebook</li> <li>front-end design</li> <li>...many others</li> </ul> Huge experience earned by this project. Especially happy to see it up and running for so many years.

<div> <p> DAZN User Experience. Modular JS client library that controls common features like ads, GDPR, content personalization, and many others - across DAZN portals. </p> <p> Each portal was using a similar subset of features and having similar set problems with them. DUX got invented to solve those problems for few dev teams, by having a dedicated team running single library. </p> <p> We created DUX using TS only as it was mostly a business logic front-end code. It had to work regardless of other dev team choices. </p>

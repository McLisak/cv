Users, based on their roles, have access to different views. Scorers are assigned to particular teams, they can view and edit team lineups at any point during the game and they can view the main pitch view, the heart of the app. Supervisors have their own dedicated view in which they can see and edit both teams lineups, view and quickly edit actions delivered by scorers of both teams. A 2 or 3-person setup is required for each match and all of them have their data and their current views synced in real time. Each user can 'travel in time', they can edit their current in-game clock time, so each user have its own current state, which has to reflect what actually happened until that. </p><p> While in pitch view, collector user has a big interactive pitch with a stream overlay. While looking at the stream, a collector tracks ball positions and whenever any action happens, they have to quickly produce that action. This means quickly selecting a player who performed an action, quickly selecting a type of action and selecting the destination position - if action had destination - or quickly providing additional data for given action. Besides that, collectors are presented all actions they created, so they can quickly see most important information about each action and if it got delivered to the system properly. Collectors can also edit or fulfill additional action data at any point during the game. Pitch view UX has a lot in common with video games. Especially seeing how experienced collectors are using it. </p><p> A supervisor sees a smaller pitch, video stream, both teams current lineups and a table of actions delivered to the system. This part of the app allows for tracking 'current' state of the game and in case of any mistake, supervisor can add or edit any action for either team. This obviously affects whats presented to other users, but real time data sync with game state control mechanism is keeping all clients presentations and data correctness in place. </p><p> This project followed a shift-left approach. A solid CI pipelines were created ahead of app development. Unit, integration and e2e tests were delivered together with every feature and bugfix. This investment not only saved so much time as the app evolved, but it also allowed to discover problems impossible to reproduce by dev team, problems that could only happen during several simultaneously ongoing games.

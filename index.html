The drum kit used my own controller source code running on Arduino module (atmega microprocessor). The controller was capturing an analog signal from piezo transducer which allowed futher transformation into digital MIDI signal including the hit velocity. The whole drum kit could be connected to PC via USB cable and could've been used as a controller for virtual drum kit softwares for casual playing or as a controller for games like Guitar Hero or Rock Band. </p> </div> <div class="timeline-item"> <span class="timeline-item-date">01/2016 - 02/2017</span> <h4>180Creative - Full Stack</h4> <p>Full Stack</p> <p> Tech stack: PHP, Apache, MySQL, JS, jQuery, angular.js (yes the first one), CSS, SCSS, git </p> <p> First job. Creating web apps and websites for clients. Each dev in the team was working mostly alone on his own projects. The process was far from perfect and the tempo was very fast. As a newbie this was a stressful, but an amazing experience. High tempo and lots of challenges helped me learn web development rapidly fast. I've been working super hard, I made a lot of mistakes, but I've earned more than enough knowledge to polish afterwards. </p> </div> <div class="timeline-item"> <span class="timeline-item-date">09/2017 - 11/2018</span> <h4> Perform - <a data-lightbox="portfolio-lightbox" data-portfolio-slide="spieler" class="portfolio-link"> Spieler </a> </h4> <p>Front End</p> <p> Tech stack: JS (vanilla), Mocha, CSS, HTML Video, Streaming libraries (hls, dash), Video Ads (Google IMA), git </p> <p> Joined Perform - Spieler project.

The idea for the team was to be an "ads experts team" handling technical aspect of the ads across Perform/DAZN Media portals.

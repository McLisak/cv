  <p>A core video player used by different teams to build their players on top of it.</p>

    The "Spieler" library was meant to solve common cross-browser problems that different teams were
    facing during their development. It had to expose unified simple API, handle different source
    formats, ads, provide customizable features and "work everywhere".

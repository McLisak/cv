    Authorization sub-app, called a "chapter" in DAZN Living Room App.
  </p>
  <p>
    A part of DAZN Living Room App running on all sort of devices like Smart TV's (Tizen, WebOS),
    Game Consoles (Playstation4 and above, Xbox One and above), set-top boxes (MagentaTV, SkyQ,
    Movistar). Built using React+mobx, but migrated to preact+context for memory consumption
    improvements on low-tier devices.

    The most interesting features I've worked on with my team was actually a full-stack features.
    Second screen sign up and sign in, both with autologin. Nobody likes filling up forms using an
    on-screen-keyboard with tv remote or game controller. It's better to scan the QR code or receive
    an SMS, sign up or sign in using your mobile device and get your living room device authorized
    automatically. I've worked on both front-end and back-end pieces of that feature.

    We used Optimizely for limited feature delivery and experimentation, NewRelic for monitoring,
    PagerDuty for alerting.

    The project was mainly a maintenance, performance improvements, UX improvements, bug fixes, few new features and
    changes in the authorization flow according to partnership deals.

    Biggest challenge was the 'Living Room' part. The devices than ran our app had very limited
    capabilities. If you think IE11 was terrible... you should see living room.

  <p>Video Ad Framework. Library that manages HTML5 Video Ads</p>
  <p>
    Before this project it was
    <a class="portfolio-link" data-portfolio-slide="spieler" data-slide-duration="null">Spieler</a>
    that was providing control over video ads. The project has grown enough to abstract the ads part
    and put it into separate library.
  </p>
  <p>
    VAF was used and proxied by Spieler, but it was designed to be used with any HTMLVideoElement
    based player. Providing a simple API, emitting events, fixing cross-browser issues, working
    mostly automatically when properly configured.

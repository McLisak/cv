    A full-stack total rebuild of DAZN living room landingpages CMS. New solution was designed
    mainly to simplify management, but it also allowed us to reduce some time-to-interactive on
    client side.

    Front end app was built using React + internal UI library + GraphQL with graphql-codegen
    generated hooks. For CMS Back-end we used express + apollo + terraform.

    The biggest challenge was actually business logic design. The project had to solve old-solution
    issues, provide more and better management possibilities, which required a lot of
    'in-advance-thinking' when designing the architecture.
    <br />
    Building the app on top of GraphQL was also very interesting part of this project.

    This Landingpage Manager also simplified the client-side logic.

    > was no longer using REST API to build the landingpage, it used ready documents 'baked' by
    CMS. Thanks to that we reduced the amount of operations done by the browser, which matters a lot
    on low-tier devices.

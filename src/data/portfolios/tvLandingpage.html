    Landingpage sub-app, called a "chapter" in DAZN Living Room App.
  </p>
  <p>
    A straightforward app that asks back-end for landingpage content, displays it and sets up user
    interaction and tracking.

    First iteration on landingpages was based on REST API. The app had to figure out what page
    elements to create, create them using data it received and append them to DOM. Second iteration
    was a lot simpler, when we launched our new CMS initiative -
    <a class="portfolio-link" data-portfolio-slide="landingpageManager" data-slide-duration="null">
      TV Landingpage Manager</a
    >.

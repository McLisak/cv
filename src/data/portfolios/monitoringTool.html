<p>A real time, websocket based application for data collection supervisors.</p>
<p>
  This tool allows users to see and adjust fast path data. A fast path data is
  collected by scorers attending the event live, in venue. Reaction speed was
  the key in this project. Supervisors needed a way to easily read the data that
  goes into system. Especially given that several events would often overalp,
  they had to be aware of what's happening on 1, 2 or more app instances at the
  same time.
</p>
<p>
  This was achieved by a well designed, compact layout of client app together
  with sound alerts and different visual notifications, ability to quick-filter
  and quick-edit the data, have different user preferences, see overall
  statistics, quickly see more detailed statistics and compare values to
  external sources and many other work-improving features.

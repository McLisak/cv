<p>An application for fast and detailed soccer event data collection.</p>
<p>
  Based on REST and Websocket, meant for real time data production and
  consumption.
</p>
<p>
  Snappy React client, heavily relying on quick hotkey input. Users, based on
  their roles, have access to different views. Scorers are assigned to
  particular teams, they can view and edit team lineups at any point during the
  game and they can view the main pitch view, the heart of the app. Supervisors
  have their own dedicated view in which they can see and edit both teams
  lineups, view and quickly edit actions delivered by scorers of both teams. A 2
  or 3-person setup is required for each match and all of them have their data
  and their current views synced in real time. Each user can 'travel in time',
  they can edit their current in-game clock time, so each user have its own
  current state, which has to reflect what actually happened until that.

  While in pitch view, collector user has a big interactive pitch with a stream
  overlay. While looking at the stream, a collector tracks ball positions and
  whenever any action happens, they have to quickly produce that action. This
  means quickly selecting a player who performed an action, quickly selecting a
  type of action and selecting the destination position - if action had
  destination - or quickly providing additional data for given action. Besides
  that, collectors are presented all actions they created, so they can quickly
  see most important information about each action and if it got delivered to
  the system properly. Collectors can also edit or fulfill additional action
  data at any point during the game. Pitch view UX has a lot in common with
  video games. Especially seeing how experienced collectors are using it.

  A supervisor sees a smaller pitch, video stream, both teams current
  lineups and a table of actions delivered to the system. This part of the app
  allows for tracking 'current' state of the game and in case of any mistake,
  supervisor can add or edit any action for either team. This obviously
  affects whats presented to other users, but real time data sync with game
  state control mechanism is keeping all clients presentations and data
  correctness in place.

  This project followed a shift-left approach. A solid CI pipelines were
  created ahead of app development. Unit, integration and e2e tests were
  delivered together with every feature and bugfix. This investment not only
  saved so much time as the app evolved, but it also allowed to discover
  problems impossible to reproduce by dev team, problems that could only happen
  during several simultaneously ongoing games. All of that without a risk of
  these problems actually happening in meaningful time.
